# Wildfire-Classification-System-Using-CNN-model-
This project aims to develop a deep learning model to identify whether an image contains a forest fire using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The model is trained using a dataset of forest fire images and evaluated for its accuracy and loss.

 The model successfully classifies images as "Fire" or "No Fire" with an accuracy of 93.95% after 10 epochs.
 By using data augmentation, dropout for regularization, and training a custom CNN model, the system is
 able to detect forest fires with high accuracy. The integration of the Gradio interface makes it easy for users
 to interact with the model, providing a practical tool for real-time wildfire detection.
