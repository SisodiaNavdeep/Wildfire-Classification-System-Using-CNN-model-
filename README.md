# Wildfire-Classification-System-Using-CNN-model-
This project aims to develop a deep learning model to identify whether an image contains a forest fire using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The model is trained using a dataset of forest fire images and evaluated for its accuracy and loss.

The model successfully detects forest fires with an accuracy of 93.95% after 10 epochs. By leveraging transfer learning with the VGG16 pre-trained model and applying appropriate data augmentation and regularization techniques, the model is able to generalize well. The Gradio interface makes it easy for users to interact with the model and make predictions on new images.
